 # Alliance War
 bm_alliancewar:0 "Three Banner War"
 bm_alliancewar_desc:0 "When Mannimarco, the King of Worms, corrupted the Amulet of Kings just before Emperor Varen's coronation ritual several years ago, he guaranteed that the covenant sealed by Alessia and Akatosh would be broken, and Nirn would no longer be protected from a Daedric invasion. Mannimarco's master, the Daedric Prince Molag Bal, seized the opportunity to initiate the Planemeld, using terrifying Dark Anchors to summon Daedric troops and drag Nirn into the realm of Coldharbour. But three political alliances — the Ebonheart Pact, Daggerfall Covenant, and Aldmeri Dominion — stand against the Daedric Prince and his forces.\n\n#bold The armies of the three alliances converge, ready to fight to the last to preserve their freedom. Never before have the disparate races cooperated so closely, but never before has the threat been so terrible.#!"
 bm_alliancewar_dominion:0 "Alliance War: Dominion"
 bm_alliancewar_dominion_desc:0 "Only the Aldmeri—the High Elves and their noble allies, the Wood Elves and Cat-Men—have the wisdom and restraint to peaceably rule the disparate peoples of Tamriel. Though we are reluctant to take up this burden, events have shown that we must. Recent events prove that the Dragon Break was not a unique event. Men always follow the destructive path of their defender and apologist, the Missing God whom we shall not name. This ends here. Once again, Elves shall rule Tamriel from White-Gold Tower... this time, forever. The world has gone wrong, and we must put it right. March proudly beneath the eagle banner of the Aldmeri Dominion! — Aicantar of Shimmerene"
 bm_alliancewar_covenant:0 "Daggerfall Covenant"
 bm_alliancewar_covenant_desc:0 "It is fortunate for our peoples — indeed, for all the peoples of Tamriel — that the true flame of the Empire of Man still burns in the Daggerfall Covenant. These are terrible times, but our destiny lies before us as straight and true as the Reman roads: we must march on Cyrodiil, overthrow the false empress and all her brood, and restore the Empire of Tamriel. Then once more peace and justice will rule the provinces, rather than blood and fire. — High King Emeric"
 bm_alliancewar_pact:0 "Ebonheart Pact"
 bm_alliancewar_pact_desc:0 "The rash actions of those who sit the Ruby Throne, or who pull their strings, have brought Tamriel to the verge of irretrievable doom. They must be scoured from the face of Cyrodiil, and the decaying remains of the Empire of Men must be swept away. It shall be replaced by the Pact, which will enforce peace across the continent and strictly regulate all involvement in dangerous magical pursuits. — Alla Lalleth"
 bm_alliancewar_kena:0 "Molag Kena"
 bm_alliancewar_kena_desc:0 "Molag Kena, disguised as the Empress Regent Clivia Tharn, ruled over the Imperial City for an indeterminate amount of time.[4] She consistently requested troops from the Imperial Legion to report to her personally, off the books. She moved the troops this way and that, having them defend positions with no strategic value and sending them off to die at the hands of the invading Daedra for nothing. Molag Kena manipulated legion officials with blackmail and other underhanded tactics to do what she wanted, and called one General Valerius to the White-Gold Tower before the Imperial City was overrun by Molag Bal's forces."

 bm_alliancewar_covenant_emeric_desc:0 "High King Emeric is the King of Wayrest and the leader of the Daggerfall Covenant. He first forged an alliance with the kingdom of Sentinel, in part by marrying Maraya, the daughter of King Fahara'jad. He later convinced many Orc tribes to join the Covenant by promising to aid in the restoration of Orsinium. He leads the Covenant from its capital city of Wayrest, and is protected by the Breton Lion Guard."

He only rules in theory in northern Wrothgar, which is a patchwork of Strongholds, but he does control southern Wrothgar. Kurog is a controversial ruler, as he joined the Daggerfall Covenant—comprising primarily Redguard and Breton states, which had antagonized the Orcs for centuries. Moreover, Kurog publicly insists that his people worship Trinimac rather than the Daedric Prince Malacath, which fails to convince many other Covenant citizens and makes him unpopular with his people. Currently he is leading a campaign to push the Winterborn out of Wrothgar."
